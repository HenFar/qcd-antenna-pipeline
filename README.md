# AntCalc

> **New in 0.3.0 β1:** massive `A30` now has a derived MX30 master-basis
> closure and an end-to-end integrated route; invariant-only `A22` builds are
> also available. `D30` remains an experimental research track.

AntCalc is a Wolfram Language package that builds and integrates QCD antenna
functions. The main workflow has two steps:

```wl
BuildAntenna[...] → IntegrateAntenna[...]
```

`BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]` runs these steps in sequence. AntCalc is
thesis research software. The massless routes are the stable release surface;
massive `A30` is a beta extension and `D30` remains experimental.

## Status

Current development release: **AntCalc 0.3.0 β1**.

The current release target is the massless antenna workflow for the NNLO SMQCD
R-ratio, with a beta massive-`A30` extension. Before using a route in a
calculation, read the [route-status matrix](docs/manual/route-status.md).

AntCalc is active, unpublished thesis research software. It is shared for
evaluation and academic discussion; reuse, redistribution, and relicensing
require prior written permission from the relevant rights holder or holders.
See [NOTICE](NOTICE) for the current distribution position.

## Install and load

After cloning the repository, install the paclet once from a Wolfram notebook
or kernel:

```wl
repoRoot = "/path/to/antenna_pipeline";
archive = CreatePacletArchive[repoRoot, $TemporaryDirectory];
PacletInstall[archive];
```

Then restart the kernel and load AntCalc normally:

```wl
<< AntCalc`
```

If the paclet was installed while the notebook kernel was already running,
evaluate `PacletDataRebuild[]`, restart the kernel, and try again.

While actively editing a cloned checkout, load its current source directly
instead of the installed paclet copy:

```wl
repoRoot = "/path/to/antenna_pipeline";
Get[FileNameJoin[{repoRoot, "AntennaPipeline.wl"}]]
```

## Quick start

```wl
<< AntCalc`

(* Unintegrated tree-level NLO antenna. *)
a30 = BuildAntenna[A, 3, 0];

(* One-shot construction and integration. *)
intA30 = BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0];

(* The explicitly modular equivalent. *)
a30Object = BuildAntenna[A, 3, 0, IntegrableForm -> True];
intA30Direct = IntegrateAntenna[a30Object];
```

manual instead.

## Dependencies

Supported workflows require Wolfram Language, FeynCalc, FeynArts, and
FeynHelpers. IBP-backed integration also requires LiteRed2. Keep the bundled
basis and runtime-master files when copying or cloning the repository.

The current beta toolchain is:

```text
FeynCalc 10.2.1 · FeynArts 3.12 (27 Mar 2025) ·
FeynHelpers 2.0.0 · FeynCalcLegacy 1.0.0
LiteRed2 2.025 β
```

## Scope

AntCalc does not currently provide a public `D30` route or complete
`SUSY`/`HiggsEFT` R-ratio workflows. The massive-`A30` beta route has a derived
master substitution and fresh-kernel qualification through
`ExpansionOrder -> 2`; deeper epsilon orders are not yet claimed. See the
[route-status matrix](docs/manual/route-status.md) for the exact limits.
