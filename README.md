# AntCalc

`AntCalc` is the official package name of this Wolfram Language project.
The repository is still named `antenna_pipeline`, and the current canonical
loader file remains `AntennaPipeline.wl`, but the package should be referred to
in the README and in ordinary use as `AntCalc`, in the style of established
field-standard names such as `FeynCalc`, which also inspired the naming.

`AntCalc` is a Wolfram Language package for building and integrating QCD
antenna functions through a small public API. The release target of this repo
is now explicit:

```text
Load one package, call a small set of public functions, and reproduce the
massless A-type antenna story needed for the NNLO SMQCD R-ratio workflow.
```

This repo is no longer presented as an open-ended “finish every branch”
research notebook. It is a package, `AntCalc`, with a completed massless target
and two callable experimental branches that are intentionally outside the
release guarantee.

## How To Read This README

This README is meant to serve three readers at once:

- package users who want to know what is supported and how to run it
- thesis/supervision readers who need to understand the package contract and
  current status honestly
- contributors who want to inspect or extend the runtime

The guiding rule is:

- supported routes are documented as the intended public package contract
- experimental routes are documented as callable but outside the release
  guarantee
- known contract mismatches are called out explicitly rather than silently
  normalized as if they were correct public behavior

## Transparency Index

This section is the shortest “what is really here?” map for both users and
developers.

- supported public physics routes:
  the massless release matrix in `## Supported Release Matrix`
- callable but non-release branches:
  `## Experimental Branches`
- intended public physics contract versus current implementation reality:
  `## Current Contract Notes`
- public functions, options, objects, and reports:
  `## Public API`, `### Public Options Reference`, and `## Record And Object Appendix`
- stored-result and cache behavior:
  `### Stored Results And Transparent Reuse`
- route metadata, conventions, and environment inspection:
  `AntennaPipelineConventionReport[]`,
  `AntennaPipelineDimRegDeclaration[]`,
  `AntennaRouteProfileReport[...]`,
  `AntennaRouteEnvironmentReport[...]`,
  and `AntennaPipelineDefaults[]`
- contributor-facing implementation structure:
  `## Internal Architecture For Modifying Routes`

Strict transparency rule:

- if a function, option, object field, route family, or workflow switch is not
  described in the public API, option reference, experimental-branch notes, or
  implementation notes below, it should be treated as internal rather than as a
  hidden supported feature
- internal developer globals and internal helper symbols may exist in the code,
  but they are not part of the public contract unless they are documented here
- this README is intended to be complete enough that a physicist can determine
  what the package promises, what it merely exposes for inspection, and what it
  does not yet claim

## Active Implementation Plan

This repository is currently being advanced through a strict task-by-task
implementation checklist rather than through unrelated opportunistic edits. The
current execution order is:

1. convention and public-contract foundation
2. build-side semantics repair
3. defaults, cache, and validation
4. massive `A30`, examples, and extensions

The active task list is:

- Task 1: stabilize the convention metadata model (done)
- Task 2: add effective route/environment resolution reporting (done)
- Task 3: declare dimensional-regularization scheme status in code (done)
- Task 4: introduce an explicit public vs bare/prototype output boundary (done)
- Task 5: repair `A31` build-side normalization and renormalization semantics (`5a` done, `5b` deferred)
- Task 6: clean up `PaXEvaluate` / `PaVe` convention handling (done)
- Task 7: add an explicit bare/prototype public option (done for direct `BuildAntenna[...]` expression output)
- Task 8: add a supported global default environment mechanism (done)
- Task 9: re-audit stored-result semantics after semantics repair
- Task 10: build a physics-aware validation layer
- Task 11: complete the massive `A30` second-master derivation
- Task 12: finish quickstart/examples/benchmarks
- Task 13: prototype the longer-term extension ideas

Current execution status:

- done
  Task 1: stabilize the convention metadata model
  Task 2: add effective route/environment resolution reporting
  Task 3: declare dimensional-regularization scheme status in code
  Task 4: introduce an explicit public vs bare/prototype output boundary
  Task 5: repair `A31` build-side normalization and renormalization semantics (`5a` done, `5b` deferred)
  Task 6: clean up `PaXEvaluate` / `PaVe` convention handling
  Task 7: add an explicit bare/prototype public option (direct `BuildAntenna[...]` expression output only)
  Task 8: add a supported global default environment mechanism
- not yet done
  Tasks 9-13

The checklist is intentionally dependency-driven. In particular, semantics
repair happens before cache re-audits, broader validation, or user-facing
polish that would otherwise document the wrong boundary.

## Completed Work Index

This is the short ledger of what the completed tasks have already changed in the
public package surface.

- Task 1:
  one canonical convention metadata model now feeds the code-level convention
  reports, so intended contract, current implementation reality, and prototype
  status are described from one source of truth
- Task 2:
  route-level environment reporting now exposes effective defaults and route
  metadata for build, integration, and one-shot calls
- Task 3:
  the dimensional-regularization declaration is now explicit in code and
  inspectable through `AntennaPipelineDimRegDeclaration[]`
- Task 4:
  build routes now carry an explicit public/prototype boundary internally rather
  than conflating the route-native payload with the intended public output
- Task 5a:
  the default `BuildAntenna[A, 3, 1, ...]` public branch now applies the
  repaired build-side presentation boundary, while the route-native branch is
  preserved for integration-facing work
- Task 5b:
  deferred; nonzero integrated `A31` residuals and deeper structural
  renormalization cleanup are still pending
- Task 6:
  the integration convention bridge is now explicit and inspectable in backend
  diagnostics rather than depending on implicit backend normalization accidents
- Task 7:
  `BuildAntenna[..., BuildOutputBranch -> "Public"|"Prototype"]` is now a
  documented public selector for direct expression output, with its support
  boundary stated honestly
- Task 8:
  supported package-wide defaults now exist through
  `AntennaPipelineDefaults[]`, `SetAntennaPipelineDefaults[...]`, and
  `ResetAntennaPipelineDefaults[]`, with explicit precedence and inspectable
  effective per-head resolutions
- Task 9:
  stored-result identity now includes a route-semantic version barrier and
  driver-level nested-default fingerprints, so repaired public semantics do not
  silently collide with older cache entries

## Release Promise

The release-complete package surface is:

- massless tree-level `A20`, `A30`, `A40`, `tildeA40`, `B40`, and `C40`
- integrated `A21`
- integrated `A30`
- integrated `A31`, `tildeA31`, and `hatA31`
- integrated `A22`, `tildeA22`, `hatA22`, and `breveA22`
- the massless `SMQCD` high-level driver
  `BuildRRatio[SMQCD, quarkMass -> 0]`
- the massless SMQCD bulk convenience routes
  `BuildAllAntennae[SMQCD, maxOrder -> LO|NLO|NNLO]`
  and `BuildAndIntegrateAllAntennae[SMQCD, ...]`
- the record/inspection layer built around `ReturnRecord` and
  `IntermediateSteps`

These are the routes the package claims as supported for external use.

## Experimental Branches

Two branches remain public-callable, but they are not part of the release
guarantee:

- massive `A30`
- `D30`

They remain in the runtime because they are useful research tracks, but they
must be understood as experimental:

- they expose diagnostics and records honestly;
- they may return unfinished results or `$Failed`;
- they are documented separately from the supported massless package promise;
- they are not the package acceptance target.

### Massive A30

The current massive `A30` status is:

- `BuildAntenna[A, 3, 0, quarkMass -> mQ]` is legitimate and package-derived
- `BuildAntennaObject[A, 3, 0, quarkMass -> mQ]` is available as the
  integration-ready public wrapper for that massive build result
- the bibliography-facing integrated result is encoded and checked as
  provenance
- the package can reduce the massive integrand to the `MX30` master
  combination
- the fully internal closed master-substitution derivation is still not
  complete

So the honest endpoint today is:

- correct unintegrated massive antenna
- explicit literature/provenance bridge for the integrated result
- package-owned reduction to masters
- no release-guaranteed closed integrated runtime result

### D30

The current `D30` status is:

- the effective source-model infrastructure exists under `src/`
- source amplitudes and source interferences are built by the runtime
- the default `BuildAntenna[D, 3, 0, ...]` call remains callable through the
  source-model route
- `AllowPrototypeTargets -> True` switches the build toward the prototype or
  paper-style branch instead of the default source-model route
- the public `BuildAntenna[D, 3, 0, ...]` route exposes that started work
  through diagnostics and run records
- the final symbolic extraction into a validated public `D30` antenna is still
  unfinished
- there is no public integration route

So `D30` is a runtime research branch, not a finished package feature.

## Current Contract Notes

The intended public contract of the package is:

- `BuildAntenna[...]` should expose package-facing antenna objects in the
  package normalization/renormalization convention
- `IntegrateAntenna[...]` and `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]` should consume and
  return objects in that same public convention
- bare or pre-counterterm intermediate expressions are provenance-level objects,
  not the default public endpoint

Not yet implemented or not yet repaired:

- some loop-family behavior, especially around `A31`, still needs cleanup so the
  public build-side result always matches that intended renormalized contract
- the README therefore documents the intended package boundary and flags the
  current mismatch instead of treating the present accidental behavior as the
  desired API
- object-facing and integration-facing prototype output is not yet a supported
  public route; `BuildAntennaObject[...]`, `ReturnAntennaObject -> True`, and
  `IntegrableForm -> True` remain pinned to the public branch intentionally

## Route Status Notes

- supported massless routes are the ones in the release matrix and in
  `dev/run_release_verification.sh`
- massive `A30` is callable and useful, but experimental
- `D30` is callable for diagnostics and source-route inspection, but
  experimental
- loop-route normalization and renormalization notes matter for interpreting the
  public contract, especially for `A21` and `A31`

## Prerequisites

The package is a Wolfram Language runtime that delegates substantial symbolic
work to the standard high-energy-physics toolchain used by the repo.

For the supported massless release workflow, you should assume the following
are available in the Wolfram environment used to load the package:

- Wolfram Kernel / `wolframscript`
- `FeynCalc`
- `FeynHelpers`
- `FeynArts`
- `LiteRed2`

The runtime checks the `FeynCalc` version it was validated against and currently
expects `FeynCalc 9.3.1`.

Dependency note:

- `FeynHelpers` and `FeynArts` are used through the `FeynCalc` environment
- `LiteRed2` is required by the IBP-backed integration routes
- once those dependencies are present, package startup itself is only
  `Get["AntennaPipeline.wl"]`

Some supported integration routes also rely on checked-in repo-owned basis or
master-value artifacts already present in the repository:

- `bases/`
- `generated_bases/`
- `masterIntegrals/master_values_runtime.wl`

Additional integration and development workflows may require the following
tools as well:

- `LiteRed` for IBP basis loading or basis generation
- `Package-X`, used through `FeynCalc`/`FeynHelpers` for `PaVe` evaluation

These extra tools are part of the runtime architecture even when a particular
user session does not touch every backend.

## Environment Assumptions

The repository is designed to be loaded from a checked-out working tree, not as
an installed paclet. The normal expectation is:

- you have the full repository locally
- the bundled `bases/`, `generated_bases/`, and `masterIntegrals/` directories
  are present
- you load [AntennaPipeline.wl](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/AntennaPipeline.wl)
  from that checkout

The package does not require the full derivation tree to be recomputed on
startup. In particular, the runtime loads the checked-in
`masterIntegrals/master_values_runtime.wl` artifact rather than rebuilding the
master-integral provenance layer on each load.

## Tested Environments

The package has been tested in at least the following local environments:

- macOS on an Apple Silicon MacBook Pro M4
- Windows on an Intel desktop PC

The README does not currently make detailed runtime or memory promises across
machines. Treat those environments as confirmed test platforms, not as a full
compatibility matrix.

## Loading

The package name is `AntCalc`, but the current checked-in loader is still
`AntennaPipeline.wl`. So for now the practical load command continues to use
the loader filename rather than a renamed `AntCalc.wl` entry point.

From a Wolfram notebook or kernel:

```wl
repoRoot = "/path/to/antenna_pipeline";
Get[FileNameJoin[{repoRoot, "AntennaPipeline.wl"}]]
```

From the terminal:

```sh
cd /path/to/antenna_pipeline
/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/WolframKernel -noprompt -run 'Get["AntennaPipeline.wl"]; Exit[]'
```

`AntennaPipeline.wl` is the only canonical loader at present, even though the
package itself is now referred to as `AntCalc`.

If you want the shortest realistic first-run sequence from the terminal:

```sh
cd /path/to/antenna_pipeline
bash dev/run_release_verification.sh
```

That command is intended to answer the practical question “does this checkout
work as a supported package installation?”

## Public API

The main public entry points are:

```wl
BuildAntenna[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder, ...]
BuildAntennaObject[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder, ...]
IntegrateAntenna[antennaObject, ...]
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder, ...]
BuildRRatio[model, ...]
TObject[order, finalState, ...]
BuildAllAntennae[model, ...]
BuildAndIntegrateAllAntennae[model, ...]
AntennaPipelineConventionReport[]
AntennaRouteProfileReport[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder]
AntennaRouteEnvironmentReport[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder]
```

The usual user-facing story is:

1. build an unintegrated antenna with `BuildAntenna[...]`
2. optionally build an integration-ready object with `BuildAntennaObject[...]`
3. integrate with `IntegrateAntenna[...]`
4. or use `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]` for the one-shot route

### API Reference

`BuildAntenna[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder, ...]`

- Purpose: build the public unintegrated antenna result for one route key.
- Input shape: an antenna key such as `{A,3,0}` written as
  `BuildAntenna[A, 3, 0, ...]`.
- Normal result shape: a scalar antenna expression, or a list of ordered public
  components when that family has a multi-component public output.
- Contract note: for some loop families, especially around `A31`, the intended
  public normalization/renormalization boundary is documented below and is not
  yet enforced uniformly by the current implementation.
- Inspection variants: may instead return diagnostics, raw build data,
  an `AntennaObject[...]`, or an `AntennaRunRecord[...]` depending on options.
- Scope: this is the main build-side public function for both supported
  massless routes and callable experimental branches.

`BuildAntennaObject[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder, ...]`

- Purpose: wrap a build result together with the metadata required by
  `IntegrateAntenna[...]`.
- Input shape: same route key as `BuildAntenna[...]`.
- Normal result shape: `AntennaObject[...]`.
- Scope: use this when you want explicit control over build and integration as
  separate stages.

`IntegrateAntenna[antennaObject, ...]`

- Purpose: integrate a built antenna object through the route-selected backend.
- Input shape: an `AntennaObject[...]` produced by `BuildAntennaObject[...]` or
  by `BuildAntenna[..., ReturnAntennaObject -> True]`.
- Normal result shape: an integrated scalar or integrated component list in the
  public package convention.
- Inspection variants: may return diagnostics, T-terms, master combinations,
  intermediate stages, or a full run record.
- Scope: this is the canonical explicit integration entry point.

`BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder, ...]`

- Purpose: run the build and integration pipeline in one public call.
- Input shape: same route key as `BuildAntenna[...]`.
- Normal result shape: the same public integrated result you would obtain by
  composing `BuildAntennaObject[...]` and `IntegrateAntenna[...]`.
- Scope: this is the easiest way to reach the supported integrated endpoints.

`BuildRRatio[model, ...]`

- Purpose: assemble the symbolic NNLO observable-level driver result from the
  supported antenna ingredients.
- Input shape: currently the supported release target is
  `BuildRRatio[SMQCD, quarkMass -> 0, ...]`.
- Normal result shape: by default the finite `MSbar`-convention result, or the
  raw dimensional-regularization series when requested.
- Scope: this is a massless release driver, not an experimental massive route.

`TObject[order, finalState, ...]`

- Purpose: build one public symbolic `T` object from the integrated antenna
  ingredients used by the massless `SMQCD` driver layer.
- Input shape: currently supported public calls use perturbative orders `2`,
  `4`, or `6` together with one of the supported final-state selectors such as
  `qqbar`, `qqbarg`, `qqbarqprimeqprimebar`, `qqbarqqbar`, or `qqbargg`.
- Normal result shape: a symbolic expression in the package's presented public
  convention, or `{result, diagnostics}` when requested.
- Scope: this is a literature-facing massless helper built on top of the same
  validated integrated ingredients as `BuildRRatio[...]`.

`AntennaPipelineConventionReport[]`

- Purpose: report the package-wide public defaults, backend expectations, and
  the current convention state in a code-inspectable association.
- Scope: this is an introspection helper, not a route executor.
- Contract note: it distinguishes intended public contract from current
  implementation reality and does not pretend unresolved dim-reg or
  renormalization questions are already settled.

`AntennaPipelineDimRegDeclaration[]`

- Purpose: report the explicit code-level dimensional-regularization
  declaration used by the package convention model.
- Scope: this is a focused introspection helper for the current package-wide
  `D -> 4 - 2 Epsilon` continuation and its support status.
- Contract note: it does not claim that separately supported `CDR`, `HV`,
  `GDR`, or similar user-selectable variants already exist.

`AntennaRouteProfileReport[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder]`

- Purpose: report the resolved build profile, integration profile, route
  stories, and route-level contract notes for one antenna key.
- Scope: this is an introspection helper for users, thesis readers, and route
  developers who want to inspect metadata without stepping through the routing
  code manually.

`AntennaRouteEnvironmentReport[type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder]`

- Purpose: report the effective build, integration, and one-shot pipeline
  defaults that would govern one route key under the current package
  environment.
- Scope: this is an introspection helper for users who want to know not only
  what a route is, but how the package currently resolves backend, scale,
  cache, prototype-routing, and mass-handling defaults for it.

`BuildAllAntennae[model, ...]`

- Purpose: bulk-build the supported massless antenna list up to `LO`, `NLO`, or
  `NNLO`.
- Input shape: `BuildAllAntennae[SMQCD, maxOrder -> LO|NLO|NNLO, ...]`.
- Normal result shape: a list of built public antenna results.
- Scope: a convenience wrapper for supported massless `SMQCD` routes only.

`BuildAndIntegrateAllAntennae[model, ...]`

- Purpose: bulk-build and bulk-integrate the supported massless antenna list.
- Input shape: `BuildAndIntegrateAllAntennae[SMQCD, maxOrder -> LO|NLO|NNLO,
  ExpansionOrder -> 0, ...]`.
- Normal result shape: a list of integrated public antenna results.
- Scope: a convenience wrapper over the one-shot route, not an independent
  physics implementation.

### Public Options Reference

The public API uses one shared family of option names. Not every option is
meaningful for every route, so the most useful way to read them is by behavior.

Selection options:

- `Component`
  Select one public component such as `Leading`, `Subleading`, `Nf`, or
  `Breve` when the chosen route has a component split.
- `Contribution`
  Select one internal contribution, such as `TwoLoopTree` or `OneLoopSelf`,
  when the route exposes a contribution-level split.

Inspection and return-shape options:

- `ReturnDiagnostics`
  Return `{result, diagnostics}` rather than only the result.
- `ReturnRecord`
  Return an `AntennaRunRecord[...]` with the result, diagnostics, and stable
  intermediate-stage view.
- `IntermediateSteps`
  Request selected named intermediate stages.
- `PrintIntermediateSteps`
  Print the requested stages to the kernel output.

Inspection default values:

- `IntermediateSteps -> {}`
- `PrintIntermediateSteps -> False`
- `ReturnBuildData`
  Return the internal build-side association used by the route layer.
- `ReturnAntennaObject`
  Return an `AntennaObject[...]` instead of only the plain antenna expression.
- `IntegrableForm`
  Request the build-side expression in the form used by downstream integration
  plumbing.
- `BuildOutputBranch`
  Select `"Public"` or `"Prototype"` for direct `BuildAntenna[...]`
  expression output. `"Prototype"` is currently an internal/provisional
  inspection path and is rejected on object/integrable returns.
- `ReturnMasterCombination`
  Return the master-combination view when the chosen integration route has one.
- `ReturnTTerms`
  Return the T-term object from the integration layer when meaningful.

Stored-result options:

- `UseStoredResults`
  Reuse a matching stored public result when available.
- `StoreResults`
  Persist a newly computed public result to the stored-results cache.
- `RefreshStoredResults`
  Force recomputation and refresh the stored cache entry.
- `ResultsCacheRoot`
  Override the default repo-local stored-results directory.

Stored-result default values:

- `UseStoredResults -> False`
- `StoreResults -> False`
- `RefreshStoredResults -> False`
- `ResultsCacheRoot -> Automatic`

Build and integration routing options:

- `quarkMass`
  Selects the massive branch when supported; the release target is massless
  unless stated otherwise.
- `ReductionBackend`
  Build-side loop reduction selector.
- `PaVeEvaluation`
  Controls whether the `PaVe` route is evaluated through `PaXEvaluate`.
- `ApplyFeynCalcMS`
  Controls whether the `FeynCalc`/`Package-X` normalization bridge is applied on
  the relevant `PaVe` integration routes.
- `ExpansionOrder`
  Sets the target epsilon-series order.
- `KinematicScale`
  Selects the symbolic scale variable used by the integration normalization
  layer.
- `NormalizeKinematicScale`
  Controls whether the selected kinematic scale is normalized to `1` in the
  final result.
- `GenerateMissingBases`
  Allow the IBP backend to generate a missing basis when that route supports it.
- `BasisFamily`, `BasisRoot`
  Low-level integration-backend overrides for IBP-family routing.
- `LoopMomentum`, `LoopMomenta`
  Loop-momentum selectors used by loop routes.
- `ApplyDimReg`
  Apply the package’s dimensional-regularization substitution.
- `ApplyStripCouplings`
  Control build-side coupling stripping.
- `ApplyCasimirSubstitution`
  Control replacement of abstract Casimirs by explicit `SU(N)` expressions.

Workflow and diagnostics options:

- `RunPaperCheck`
  Request paper-target validation when that route has a paper-check layer.
- `AllowPrototypeTargets`
  Permit explicitly prototype or provisional target routes when supported.
- `UseSourceModelRoute`
  Force the source-model route where that experimental branch supports it.
- `DetailedTimingDiagnostics`
  Request extended timing diagnostics from heavy integration routes.
- `printDiagram`, `Verbose`, `prefactor`
  Build-side workflow controls used mainly for route inspection and derivation.

Public-versus-internal note:

- the options listed in this reference are the supported user-visible switches
- options documented here may still be marked experimental or provisional in
  meaning, but they are not hidden features
- symbols or globals that are not documented here should be treated as internal
  implementation controls for developers rather than as part of the external
  package contract

Driver-specific options:

- `ResultForm`
  For `BuildRRatio[...]`, the current public forms are `"FiniteMSBar"` and
  `"RawDimRegSeries"`.
- `maxOrder`
  For bulk helpers, choose `LO`, `NLO`, or `NNLO` either as uppercase symbols
  or as the corresponding uppercase strings.

Function-to-option notes:

- `BuildAntenna[...]` has the richest build-side option surface.
- `BuildAntennaObject[...]` uses the `BuildAntenna[...]` option set except for
  `ReturnRecord`.
- `IntegrateAntenna[...]` and `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]` share the same
  integration option surface.
- `BuildRRatio[...]` exposes inspection and stored-result options, but not the
  full low-level integration-routing surface.
- bulk helpers currently expose only `quarkMass`, `maxOrder`, and
  `ExpansionOrder` where relevant; they do not currently expose the full
  stored-result option family directly.

### Components And Contributions

Several public routes return more than one physically meaningful piece. The
README should be read with a distinction between component splits and
contribution splits.

Component split:

- a route returns multiple public package-facing pieces that all belong to the
  same family
- these are selected with `Component -> ...`

Contribution split:

- a route is assembled from multiple build or integration contributions that are
  meaningful to inspect separately
- these are selected with `Contribution -> ...`

The current canonical component orders are:

- `A40`: `{Leading, Subleading}`
- `A31`: `{Leading, Subleading, Nf}`
- `A22`: `{Leading, Subleading, Nf, Breve}`

How to read those names:

- `Leading` and `Subleading` refer to the public color-structure split exposed
  by the package
- `Nf` is the fermion-flavor contribution exposed as its own public component
  on routes such as `A31` and `A22`
- `Breve` is the extra public `A22` component associated with the one-loop/self
  route contribution

The most important route-shape cases are:

- `A40`-family routes return a two-component public structure
- `A31` returns three public integrated components, which feed the
  `BuildRRatio[...]` assembly as `intA31`, `intTildeA31`, and `intHatA31`
- `A22` returns four public integrated components, which feed
  `BuildRRatio[...]` as `intA22`, `intTildeA22`, `intHatA22`, and
  `intBreveA22`
- `A22` also has a contribution split at the route level, most notably
  `TwoLoopTree` and `OneLoopSelf`

Examples:

```wl
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 4, 0, Component -> Leading]
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 1, Component -> Nf]
BuildAntenna[A, 2, 2, Contribution -> TwoLoopTree, ReturnDiagnostics -> True]
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 2, 2, Contribution -> OneLoopSelf, ReturnRecord -> True]
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 1, ReturnDiagnostics -> True]
```

For `A22`, the build/integration distinction matters more than for the one-loop
routes. `BuildAntenna[A, 2, 2, ...]` returns the unintegrated two-loop object
split into its public components; it does not promise a generic
`PaVe`-reduced form. The reduced `A22` route lives on the integration side,
where the two-loop branch is handled through the package’s dedicated
master-integral machinery rather than through a generic one-loop `PaVe` basis.

### Normalization And Renormalization State

Task 1 status:

- done: the package now has a canonical code-level convention model in the core
  metadata registry rather than relying only on README prose or ad hoc runtime
  report assembly
- done: build and integration profiles now carry route-level convention
  subrecords
- not yet done: the actual loop-family build-side boundary repair, especially
  around `A31`

Task 2 status:

- done: the package now exposes a separate route-environment report so users
  can inspect effective build/integration defaults rather than only raw option
  declarations or route-profile metadata
- done: the report includes effective backend, `PaVeEvaluation`, scale
  normalization, cache-policy defaults, prototype-routing defaults, and
  mass-handling notes
- done: configurable package-wide default overrides are now supported through a
  dedicated defaults layer, and the route-environment report now includes that
  global-default state explicitly

Task 3 status:

- done: the package now declares its dim-reg state explicitly in code rather
  than leaving it as an unresolved placeholder
- done: the declaration records one package-wide
  `D -> 4 - 2 Epsilon` continuation controlled by `ApplyDimReg`
- done: the declaration explicitly says this is not yet a supported
  user-selectable `CDR` / `HV` / `GDR` distinction
- not yet done: validated convention toggles or route-selectable
  external-state prescriptions

Task 4 status:

- done: build-route data now carries an explicit output-boundary record with
  separate `Public` and `Prototype` branches
- done: `BuildAntenna[...]` and `BuildAntennaObject[...]` now read the public
  branch intentionally instead of treating the route-native component payload
  as an implicit contract by accident
- done: build records, diagnostics, and `ReturnBuildData -> True` now retain
  the prototype branch alongside the public branch for inspection and later
  semantic repair work
- not yet done: route-specific cases where the public and prototype branches
  should differ physically still need the actual semantics repair, especially
  for loop routes such as `A31`

Task 5 status:

- done: the `A31` build route now distinguishes its public branch from the raw
  prototype branch in a physically meaningful way rather than only structurally
- done: the public `A31` build branch now applies the explicit lower-`A30` UV
  counterterm pattern, while the prototype branch preserves the pre-counterterm
  extracted one-loop components
- done: the previously suspicious `A31` quark-loop / `Nf` build-side behavior
  is now confined to the prototype branch; the public branch carries a nonzero
  `Nf` contribution as intended
- done: Task `5a` is treated as complete; default public
  `BuildAntenna[A, 3, 1, ...]` now exposes the repaired build-side branch
  while the older route-native object flow is left intact
- deferred: Task `5b`; the integrated leading and subleading `A31` residuals
  are still nonzero, so the deeper integrated correctness work is being kept
  separate from the build-side presentation repair

The intended public contract is:

- `BuildAntenna[...]` should expose package-facing results in the package
  normalization and renormalization convention
- `IntegrateAntenna[...]` and `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]` should preserve
  that same public convention
- raw pre-counterterm or bare algebra is an internal/provenance object unless a
  future explicit option exposes it intentionally

The package currently uses `q2` as the canonical kinematic normalization scale
for public integrated routes. The integration layer exposes this explicitly
through:

- `KinematicScale -> q2` by default
- `NormalizeKinematicScale -> True` by default on the integration surface

For loop routes there are two distinct normalization layers to keep separate:

- build-side loop-amplitude normalization inside the package extraction logic
- integration-side convention conversion after `PaVe` or `IBP` reduction

In particular:

- the loop build/extraction layer uses `LoopExpansionNormalization[1] = 8 Pi^2`
  and `LoopExpansionNormalization[2] = (8 Pi^2)^2` when converting loop objects
  into the package expansion convention
- a `PaVe`-reduced loop antenna is therefore not automatically identical to the
  final public integrated result seen by users
- when the package evaluates a `PaVe` object through `PaXEvaluate`, the result
  must still pass through the route-specific normalization/convention bridge
  rather than being interpreted as the final public package value “as is”

On the `PaVe` / `Package-X` side:

- `PaVeEvaluation -> "PaXEvaluate"` is the default public evaluation mode
- `ApplyFeynCalcMS -> True` is the default integration-side setting
- for the massless two-parton `A21` route, the integration backend applies an
  explicit Package-X-to-paper conversion factor rather than treating the raw
  `PaXEvaluate` output as already in the final package convention

Task 6 status:

- done: the integration backend now distinguishes raw IBP master-substituted
  expressions from the final public integrated convention instead of treating
  them as automatically identical
- done: the IBP layer now applies an explicit backend-to-public convention
  factor for loop families such as `A31` and `A22`
- done: `KinematicScale`, `NormalizeKinematicScale`, and `ApplyFeynCalcMS` now
  flow through the IBP normalization stage itself rather than only through the
  higher-level integration interface
- done: backend diagnostics now expose the applied
  `"ConventionBridgeFactor"` so convention debugging is inspectable in code
- verified locally: a direct `WolframKernel` probe confirms that the A31 IBP
  convention factor is now present in `NormalizeIBPIntegratedResult[...]`
- not yet verified end to end: the heavy full-route `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 1,
  ReturnDiagnostics -> True]` residual recheck still needs a completed run

Dimensional-regularization declaration:

- the package now explicitly declares a single code-level dimensional
  continuation of the form `D -> 4 - 2 Epsilon`
- that continuation is activated through `ApplyDimReg`
- it is currently a package-wide working assumption, not a menu of separately
  supported external-state prescriptions
- the code now says something more precise than “undeclared”, while still not
  overclaiming support for `CDR`, `HV`, `GDR`, or related toggles

Current implementation status:

- the intended contract is that public build results are already in the package
  renormalization state
- some loop-family behavior, especially around `A31`, still needs repair to make
  that build-side contract hold uniformly
- the integration-side convention bridge for `A21` and the IBP loop families is
  now explicit in code, but the heavy `A31` end-to-end residual recheck is
  still treated as pending verification rather than silently assumed correct
- until that repair lands, the README should be read as documenting the intended
  public boundary, with this mismatch recorded openly rather than hidden

The same state is now inspectable in code:

```wl
AntennaPipelineConventionModel[]
AntennaPipelineConventionReport[]
AntennaPipelineDimRegDeclaration[]
AntennaRouteProfileReport[A, 3, 1]
AntennaRouteEnvironmentReport[A, 3, 1]
```

Not yet implemented:

- object-facing and integration-facing prototype output selection
- any stable public promise that every route's prototype branch already carries
  a physics-clean derivation payload beyond provenance inspection

The current stable claim is narrower:

- `BuildAntenna[..., BuildOutputBranch -> "Prototype"]` is now a supported
  prototype-facing inspection path for direct expression output
- that prototype branch is documented as internal/provisional in meaning, not
  as a second stable public physics contract
- `BuildAntennaObject[...]`, `ReturnAntennaObject -> True`, and
  `IntegrableForm -> True` continue to expose only the public branch

### Stored Results And Transparent Reuse

The runtime includes a stored-result layer for public-route reuse. The intended
contract is that stored results should be usable transparently across the public
route family rather than as a private notebook trick.

The user-facing controls are:

- `UseStoredResults`
  Attempt to load a matching stored public result instead of recomputing it.
- `StoreResults`
  Save a successful newly computed public result.
- `RefreshStoredResults`
  Recompute the route and overwrite the matching stored entry.
- `ResultsCacheRoot`
  Use a non-default cache root.

Behavioral notes:

- stored results are replays of public-route outputs, not a second derivation
  engine
- when a stored result is used, the route still formats the return into the same
  public shape expected by the caller
- diagnostics are annotated so callers can distinguish cached reuse from a fresh
  run
- cache identity is not just the visible call arguments; it also includes the
  route kind, a route-semantic version, and any convention-critical nested
  defaults that can change the public meaning of the result
- after a semantics repair, older stored entries are intentionally treated as
  stale rather than silently replayed under the new contract
- `BuildAntenna[..., BuildOutputBranch -> "Public"]` and
  `BuildAntenna[..., BuildOutputBranch -> "Prototype"]` are stored under
  different cache identities and therefore do not collide
- driver-level stored results for `BuildRRatio[...]` and `TObject[...]` also
  encode the effective nested `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]` convention
  defaults they depend on, so package-wide environment changes do not reuse a
  semantically stale top-level cache hit
- `PrintIntermediateSteps -> True` prints fresh intermediate stages on a fresh
  run; on a stored-result replay it prints the stored intermediate-stage payload
  when that payload is present rather than silently suppressing the stage view
- the one-shot `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]` route forwards its stored-result
  controls consistently into the delegated build stage as well as its own
  top-level cache layer

Current public coverage:

- explicit stored-result options exist on `BuildAntenna[...]`
- explicit stored-result options exist on `BuildAntennaObject[...]`
- explicit stored-result options exist on `IntegrateAntenna[...]`
- explicit stored-result options exist on `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]`
- explicit stored-result options exist on `BuildRRatio[...]`
- explicit stored-result options exist on `TObject[...]`
- bulk helper wrappers do not currently expose the full stored-result option
  family directly

Not yet implemented:

- transparent stored-result controls on the bulk helper wrappers
- a fully uniform user-facing cache story across every top-level public entry
  point

Examples:

```wl
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0, UseStoredResults -> True]
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0, StoreResults -> True]
BuildRRatio[SMQCD, quarkMass -> 0, UseStoredResults -> True]
BuildAntenna[A, 3, 1, ReturnRecord -> True, StoreResults -> True]
```

## Happy Path

The canonical onboarding workflow is:

1. Load the package.
2. Run one build example.
3. Run one integrated example.
4. Run the release verification script.
5. Optionally inspect records and intermediate stages.

Representative examples:

```wl
BuildAntenna[A, 2, 0]
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0]
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0, ReturnRecord -> True]
BuildRRatio[SMQCD, quarkMass -> 0]
BuildRRatio[SMQCD, quarkMass -> 0, ResultForm -> "RawDimRegSeries"]
BuildAllAntennae[SMQCD, maxOrder -> NNLO]
BuildAndIntegrateAllAntennae[SMQCD, maxOrder -> NNLO, ExpansionOrder -> 0]
```

## What Success Looks Like

For a basic external-user installation check, the important thing is not the
exact algebraic form of every expression, but whether the public routes return
the expected kind of object without manual setup beyond `Get[...]`.

Typical successful result shapes are:

- `BuildAntenna[A, 2, 0]`
  returns a plain Wolfram expression for the selected antenna.
- `BuildAntenna[A, 3, 1]`
  returns a multi-part list corresponding to the route's public component
  structure unless `Component` or `Contribution` narrows it.
- `BuildAntennaObject[...]`
  returns an `AntennaObject[...]` suitable for later integration.
- `IntegrateAntenna[...]` and `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]`
  return the plain integrated result by default and an `AntennaRunRecord[...]`
  when `ReturnRecord -> True`.
- `BuildRRatio[SMQCD, quarkMass -> 0]`
  returns the assembled public `R`-ratio expression in the selected
  `ResultForm`.
- `BuildAllAntennae[...]` and `BuildAndIntegrateAllAntennae[...]`
  return ordered lists following the documented route order for the supported
  massless release set.

If you ask for a record:

```wl
rec = BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0, ReturnRecord -> True];
Keys[rec]
```

you should expect stable top-level entries such as `"Result"`,
`"Diagnostics"`, and `"IntermediateSteps"`, with additional route-dependent
fields documented later in this README.

## Bulk Workflows

For the fully implemented massless SMQCD release target, the package also
ships two convenience drivers that walk the supported antenna list up to a
chosen perturbative order:

- `BuildAllAntennae[SMQCD, maxOrder -> LO|NLO|NNLO]`
- `BuildAndIntegrateAllAntennae[SMQCD, maxOrder -> LO|NLO|NNLO,
  ExpansionOrder -> 0]`

Their current scope is intentionally narrow:

- they are implemented for `SMQCD`
- they accept either uppercase order symbols `LO`, `NLO`, and `NNLO` or the
  corresponding uppercase strings
- their massless target is the same supported `A`, `B`, and `C` release set
- they are convenience wrappers over `BuildAntenna[...]` and
  `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]`, not independent physics routes

The current SMQCD lists are:

- `LO`: `A20`
- `NLO`: `A20`, `A30`, `A21`
- `NNLO`: `A20`, `A30`, `A21`, `A40`, `B40`, `C40`, `A31`, `A22`

The return value follows that order directly:

- `BuildAllAntennae[...]` returns a list of built results in the `LO`, `NLO`,
  or `NNLO` route order above
- `BuildAndIntegrateAllAntennae[...]` returns a list of integrated results in
  the same order
- keyed wrappers may be added later, but they are not the current public
  contract

They are not yet the right entry point for experimental massive work:

- nonzero `quarkMass` currently aborts in these bulk helpers
- `SUSY` and `HiggsEFT` bulk enumeration are scaffolded but not implemented

If you want inspectable state rather than only the final result:

```wl
rec = BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0, ReturnRecord -> True];
rec["Result"]
rec["IntermediateSteps"]
rec["Diagnostics"]
rec["MasterCombination"]
```

The default behavior is unchanged: without `ReturnRecord -> True`, the public
functions still return the same plain result shapes as before.

## Release Verification

The canonical package acceptance script is:

```sh
cd /path/to/antenna_pipeline
bash dev/run_release_verification.sh
```

That script checks only the supported release matrix. It is the intended
“does this package installation work?” command for external users.

Operational notes:

- it requires `wolframscript` on `PATH`
- it uses the repo-local `AntennaPipeline.wl` loader for each test case
- it excludes experimental massive `A30` and `D30`
- it is more than a trivial smoke test: it exercises representative supported
  build, integrate, record, and driver routes

The exact runtime depends strongly on the local Wolfram setup and symbolic
backend performance, so the README does not promise a fixed duration. Treat it
as the canonical acceptance run rather than as a near-instant probe.

Long-running public routes now emit lightweight start/finish progress prints so
users can tell the difference between a genuinely active heavy computation and a
silent stall.

A lighter smoke test is:

```sh
cd /path/to/antenna_pipeline
/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/WolframKernel -noprompt -run 'Get["AntennaPipeline.wl"]; Print[BuildAntenna[A,2,0]]; Print[BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A,3,0]]; Exit[]'
```

The benchmark harness remains available, but it is not the acceptance test:

```sh
cd /path/to/antenna_pipeline
/Applications/Wolfram.app/Contents/MacOS/WolframKernel -noprompt -script dev/run_public_route_benchmarks.wl
```

Tracked future work:

- publish representative timing benchmarks for the supported release routes on
  the tested environments
- keep those timings separate from the correctness-facing acceptance workflow so
  performance notes do not get confused with release validation

## Glossary

- `Route`
  One public or internal execution path identified by an antenna family and
  the metadata needed to build or integrate it.
- `Profile`
  The registry entry that tells the package how a route should be built,
  normalized, integrated, and post-processed.
- `Component`
  A structural part of a multi-piece antenna family such as `Leading`,
  `Subleading`, `Nf`, or `Breve`.
- `Contribution`
  A physics-source selector used on routes that split by origin, for example a
  self-energy or loop-insertion contribution.
- `AntennaObject`
  The metadata-carrying wrapper used to transport a built antenna cleanly into
  the integration layer.
- `AntennaRunRecord`
  The inspectable result container returned by `ReturnRecord -> True`.
- `Stored result`
  A cached build or integration result reused through
  `UseStoredResults` / `StoreResults`.
- `Open master values`
  Runtime master-integral replacements loaded from the checked-in
  `master_values_runtime.wl` artifact rather than regenerated on the fly.

## Experimental Inspection

The experimental branches remain callable, but should be used with that status
in mind.

Massive `A30` build-side route:

```wl
BuildAntenna[A, 3, 0, quarkMass -> mQ, ReturnRecord -> True]
BuildAntennaObject[A, 3, 0, quarkMass -> mQ]
```

Massive `A30` integrated-route diagnostics:

```wl
BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0, quarkMass -> mQ, ReturnDiagnostics -> True]
```

`D30` source-route diagnostics:

```wl
BuildAntenna[D, 3, 0, ReturnDiagnostics -> True]
BuildAntenna[D, 3, 0, ReturnRecord -> True]
```

Research and provenance material for those branches lives under:

- [dev/massiveA30](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/dev/massiveA30)
- [dev/massiveA30_sources](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/dev/massiveA30_sources)
- [dev/d30](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/dev/d30)

## Runtime Master Values

The runtime `A31` and `A22` master substitutions are intentionally loaded from
a checked-in artifact rather than recomputed on package load:

- artifact:
  [masterIntegrals/master_values_runtime.wl](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/masterIntegrals/master_values_runtime.wl)
- provenance layer:
  [masterIntegrals/](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/masterIntegrals)

Refresh the artifact after changing the derivation-side files:

```sh
cd /path/to/antenna_pipeline
bash masterIntegrals/run_kernel.sh -run 'Get["masterIntegrals/export_runtime_master_values.wl"]; Exit[]'
```

Validate it against the live derivation layer:

```sh
cd /path/to/antenna_pipeline
bash masterIntegrals/run_kernel.sh -run 'Get["dev/validate_runtime_master_values.wl"]; Exit[]'
```

## Provenance And Source Mapping

The runtime is package code, but several targets and master-integral inputs are
deliberately tied to explicit literature provenance. The current top-level map
is:

- `hep-ph/0403057`
  source for the `R`-ratio and `T`-object construction, and for the `A31` and
  `A22` master-integral provenance used by the package
- `hep-ph/0311276`
  source for the `A40`, `B40`, and `C40` master-integral provenance
- `hep-ph/0505111`
  source for the remaining main antenna targets and comparison objects used by
  the package

This does not mean every runtime expression is merely copied from the papers.
The package distinguishes between:

- package-owned routing, normalization, diagnostics, and integration plumbing
- imported or provenance-tied targets and master values
- explicit experimental branches where the package still exposes honest partial
  or literature-bridged results rather than claiming a fully internal
  derivation

That distinction is important for thesis use, supervision, and open-source
readers: the package is meant to be both executable software and an honest map
of where each result comes from.

## Stored Results And Runtime Artifacts

The runtime includes a repo-local stored-result cache under `stored_results/`.
This is a usability feature, not a second source of truth: cached results are
replays of public-route outputs, while the route implementations remain the
authoritative computation layer.

Checked-in runtime artifacts matter in two different ways:

- `stored_results/` contains reusable public-route outputs
- `bases/`, `generated_bases/`, and
  `masterIntegrals/master_values_runtime.wl` support integration backends and
  runtime master substitution

Normal users do not need to regenerate these on every run. If you are doing
derivation or backend work, then the relevant `dev/` and `masterIntegrals/`
scripts become part of the workflow.

## Repository Layout

The release-facing surface is intentionally small:

- [AntennaPipeline.wl](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/AntennaPipeline.wl)
  is the canonical loader
- [src/](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/src)
  is the canonical runtime source tree
- [dev/](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/dev)
  contains release verification, benchmarks, and research/provenance scripts
- [masterIntegrals/](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/masterIntegrals)
  contains derivation-owned master-integral provenance for runtime values

See
[src/README.md](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/src/README.md)
for the runtime architecture walkthrough and
[dev/README.md](/Users/henriquefarinha/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/msc_thesis/thesis_docs/codexAlley/antenna_pipeline/dev/README.md)
for the development-script map.

## Troubleshooting

- If `bash dev/run_release_verification.sh` fails immediately with
  `wolframscript was not found on PATH`, make sure the Wolfram command-line
  tools are installed and visible in the shell environment running the script.
- If package load fails early inside `src/core/setup.wl`, the most likely cause
  is a missing or incompatible `FeynCalc` / `FeynArts` / `FeynHelpers`
  installation.
- If a route fails inside the `IBP` backend, check that the repository basis
  directories are present and that the required runtime artifacts have not been
  removed from `bases/`, `generated_bases/`, or `masterIntegrals/`.
- If an experimental route such as massive `A30` or `D30` returns `$Failed`,
  that is not automatically an installation failure. Those branches are
  intentionally callable but outside the supported release guarantee.
- If a bulk helper aborts on nonzero `quarkMass`, lowercase `maxOrder`, or
  unsupported models such as `SUSY` / `HiggsEFT`, that is current package
  behavior rather than a broken installation.
- If you modify derivation-side master-integral files and then see mismatches in
  integrated routes, refresh and revalidate
  `masterIntegrals/master_values_runtime.wl` before assuming the runtime route
  is wrong.

## Known Non-Goals

This release does not claim:

- a fully internal closed massive `A30` master-substitution derivation
- a finished public `D30` antenna extraction
- a finished `SUSY` or `HiggsEFT` `R`-ratio route
- that every research/provenance script under `dev/` is part of the supported
  user workflow

The project is considered complete around the massless package goal, not
around finishing every exploratory physics branch.

## API Appendix

### Option Meaning Notes

- `Component` only matters on routes with public component splits such as
  `A40`, `A31`, and `A22`.
- `Contribution` only matters on routes with a contribution-level split, most
  notably `A22`.
- `UseStoredResults`, `StoreResults`, `ResultsCacheRoot`, and
  `RefreshStoredResults` are first-class public controls on the main build,
  integration, and driver routes, but not yet exposed through the bulk helper
  wrappers.
- the public defaults for the cache and inspection controls are:
  `UseStoredResults -> False`,
  `StoreResults -> False`,
  `RefreshStoredResults -> False`,
  `ResultsCacheRoot -> Automatic`,
  `IntermediateSteps -> {}`,
  `PrintIntermediateSteps -> False`
- `PrintIntermediateSteps -> True` prints requested intermediate stages on fresh
  runs, and on stored-result replays it prints the stored intermediate-stage
  payload when available.
- `AllowPrototypeTargets` and `UseSourceModelRoute` are branch-level
  or derivation-level controls and should not be read as part of the stable
  release contract.

## Record And Object Appendix

The package exposes two important metadata wrappers:

- `AntennaObject[...]`
- `AntennaRunRecord[...]`

These are part of the inspection and workflow surface and should be understood
as public containers, even though many of their fields are route-owned.

### `AntennaObject[...]`

Purpose:

- carry a built antenna together with the route metadata needed by
  `IntegrateAntenna[...]`

Core fields:

- `Key`
  The route key `{type, multiplicity, loopOrder}`.
- `Profile`
  The resolved `AntennaProfile[...]` metadata.
- `BuildData`
  The route-owned internal build association.
- `FullAntenna`
  The full unselected public build result.
- `Antenna`
  The currently selected antenna payload.
- `SelectedComponent`
  The current component selector.
- `SelectedComponentName`
  The normalized string form of the selected component.
- `Contribution`
  The current contribution selector.
- `ContributionName`
  The normalized string form of the selected contribution.

Related accessors:

- `AntennaKey[obj]`
- `AntennaComponent[obj]`
- `AntennaContribution[obj]`
- `AntennaExpression[obj]`
- `AntennaFullExpression[obj]`
- `AntennaObjectData[obj]`

### `AntennaRunRecord[...]`

Purpose:

- package the result, diagnostics, and a stable view of intermediate stages for
  a completed public route

Guaranteed minimal fields:

- `RouteKind`
  The public route that produced the record, such as `BuildAntenna` or
  `IntegrateAntenna`.
- `Result`
  The final selected public result.
- `Diagnostics`
  The route diagnostics association.
- `IntermediateSteps`
  The stable stage view exposed for record inspection.

Build-side record fields:

- `BuildData`
  The route-owned internal build association.
- `BuildOutputBoundarySummary`
  A compact summary of the public/prototype build boundary, showing the
  contract roles, normalization state, and which components coincide or differ.
- `BuildOutputBoundary`
  The explicit public/prototype build boundary record, including the
  route-facing renormalization/output split when that route defines one.
- `FullBuildResult`
  The full public build result before component selection.
- `SelectedBuildResult`
  The selected build result.
- `AntennaObject`
  The integration-ready `AntennaObject[...]` when relevant.
- `BuildDiagnostics`
  The build diagnostics alias.

Integration-side record fields:

- `SourceObject`
  The build-side source object used as integration input.
- `AntennaObject`
  The integration input object.
- `StoredResultCache`
  Stored-result metadata when the output came from cache machinery.
- `InputAntenna`
  The antenna expression fed into the integration route.
- `RawIntegrated`
  The pre-T-term integrated expression.
- `TTerms`
  The T-term object.
- `FinalIntegrated`
  The integrated result before final selection.
- `SelectedIntegrated`
  The selected integrated result.
- `BackendDiagnostics`
  The backend-specific diagnostics association.
- `IntegrationDiagnostics`
  The top-level integration diagnostics alias.

Route-dependent integration aliases that may appear when meaningful:

- `IntegratedResultKind`
- `OpenMasterValuesQ`
- `RawLiteRedCombination`
- `MasterMappedExpression`
- `RawMasterCombination`
- `MasterCombination`
- `MasterSubstitutedExpression`
- `NormalizedBeforeSeries`
- `SeriesResult`
- `OpenMasterRouteAvailable`
- `OpenMasterRouteSucceeded`
- `OpenMasterSubstitutedExpression`
- `OpenMasterSeriesResult`
- `OpenMasterRouteDiagnostics`

Important interpretation note:

- not every record contains every field above
- some fields are guaranteed by record kind
- others appear only when the chosen route and backend make them meaningful
- missing values are represented honestly rather than hidden

### `IntermediateSteps`

`IntermediateSteps` is the stable inspection view intended for human reading and
notebook-style debugging. The exact contents depend on route kind, but the
record helpers deliberately preserve a small set of canonical stage names.

Typical build-side stages include:

- `Amplitude`
- `Interference`
- `BuildOutputBoundarySummary`
- `BuildOutputBoundary`
- `Result`
- `Diagnostics`

Typical integration-side stages include:

- `BuiltAntenna`
- `Method`
- `MasterCombination`
- `DimensionExpression`
- `Result`

Driver-side `BuildRRatio[...]` intermediate-step labels currently include:

- `IngredientCalls`
- `Ingredients`
- `AssemblyExpression`
- `FinalExpression`
- `DriverDiagnostics`

### Record Usage Examples

```wl
rec = BuildAntenna[A, 3, 1, ReturnRecord -> True];
rec["Result"]
rec["Diagnostics"]
rec["IntermediateSteps"]

intRec = BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[A, 3, 0, ReturnRecord -> True];
intRec["MasterCombination"]
intRec["TTerms"]
intRec["IntermediateSteps"]
```

## Internal Architecture For Modifying Routes

Users who want to extend the package, add a new branch, or change the behavior
of an existing antenna family should read the code as a profile-driven system
rather than as one long chain of direct function calls.

The shortest accurate mental model is:

```text
public API call
  -> normalize a route key {type, multiplicity, loop order}
  -> look up metadata for that key
  -> run the workflow selected by that metadata
  -> format the result into a stable public shape
```

That metadata lookup is the center of gravity of the runtime.

If you want the shortest contributor path through the codebase, start in this
order:

1. `src/core/profiles.wl`
2. `src/routes/build_workflows.wl`
3. `src/routes/integration_workflows.wl`
4. `src/interface/build_router.wl`
5. `src/interface/integration_router.wl`

That sequence shows the package in the order it actually thinks: declare route
metadata first, then define route workflows, then adapt those workflows into a
stable public API.

### Why the package is profile-centric

The package supports several antenna families that are close enough to share a
public API but different enough that they should not be forced through one
hard-coded production formula.

Examples:

- `A30` tree level is a straightforward self-interference route.
- `A40` needs a color-ordered reconstruction layer.
- `B40` and `C40` are easier to build sector by sector.
- `A21` is naturally built through a one-loop `PaVe`-style route.
- `A31` and `A22` need different extraction logic and different integration
  backends even though they are both loop-level objects.
- massive `A30` and `D30` are genuine runtime branches, but they need to carry
  explicit honesty about experimental status.

If all of those choices were written directly into the public functions, the
API layer would become a long nest of family-specific `Switch` statements and
special cases. The profile-centric design avoids that. Instead, the public and
workflow layers ask a registry:

- what family is this?
- how should it be produced?
- how should it be extracted?
- what normalization applies?
- which backend should integration use?
- which diagnostics and route story should be attached?

That design makes the code easier to audit. It also makes branch work much
safer: most modifications are localized to metadata plus one workflow, instead
of requiring invasive edits across the entire package.

### The central object: the route key

Nearly all runtime dispatch starts from a key of the form:

```wl
{type, numFinalParticles, loopOrder}
```

Typical examples are:

- `{A, 3, 0}` for `A30`
- `{A, 2, 1}` for `A21`
- `{A, 2, 2}` for `A22`
- `{B, 4, 0}` for `B40`

That key is the compact identifier passed between the public interface, the
profile registry, the route workflows, and the integration layer.

### What lives in the profile registry

The main registry lives in `src/core/profiles.wl`. It is split into a few
closely related functions.

`AntennaProfile[key]` is the main build-side metadata record. Depending on the
family, it can specify:

- a readable name such as `A30` or `C40`
- the antenna type and multiplicity
- the production mode, such as `SelfInterference`,
  `ColorOrderedAntenna`, `SectorSelfInterference`, or
  `SectorSymmetrizedInterference`
- the extraction mode, such as `BornScalar`, `TreeColorCoefficients`,
  `LoopScalar`, `LoopColorCoefficients`, or `TwoLoopTTermComponents`
- normalization data such as `ColourNorm`
- sector definitions for routes that are built from sector splits
- component and contribution lists for multi-part routes such as `A22`
- implementation-status markers for experimental branches

`AntennaReductionProfile[key]` stores build-side loop-reduction preferences.
This is separate because “how to reduce the loop object before extraction” is
not always the same question as “how to integrate the final antenna later.”

`AntennaIntegrationProfile[key]` stores integration-side routing metadata:

- default backend, usually `PaVe` or `IBP`
- basis family, when the route is basis-driven
- expansion order
- convention metadata for routes such as `A21`
- branch-specific integration status when the route is still scaffolded or
  experimental

The same registry file now also owns the canonical package convention model used
by the runtime reports. In other words, the top-level convention story is no
longer meant to live only in README prose or ad hoc report assembly; it is part
of the core metadata layer alongside the route profiles themselves.

Two further helpers live in the same file and are important to understand:

- `AntennaAmplitude[key]`
- `AntennaSelfInterference[key]`

Task 1 implementation note:

- the same metadata registry now also owns `AntennaPipelineConventionModel[]`,
  `BuildAntennaConventionProfile[...]`, and
  `IntegrationAntennaConventionProfile[...]`
- in other words, the top-level convention story is now part of the core code
  metadata layer itself, not only part of documentation prose

Task 2 implementation note:

- the runtime now also exposes `AntennaRouteEnvironmentReport[...]` as the
  companion to `AntennaRouteProfileReport[...]`
- the profile report answers “what kind of route is this?”, while the
  environment report answers “how would the current package defaults resolve if
  I called this route now?”

Task 3 implementation note:

- the metadata registry now also owns `AntennaPipelineDimRegDeclaration[]`
- the convention model consumes that declaration directly instead of storing an
  unresolved “not yet explicitly declared” placeholder
- the declaration is intentionally narrow: it records the actual
  `D -> 4 - 2 Epsilon` continuation in use without pretending that separately
  supported `CDR` / `HV` / `GDR` branches already exist

Task 4 implementation note:

- build-side route associations now carry a canonical `BuildOutputBoundary`
  subrecord with explicit `Public` and `Prototype` branches
- the default public build formatter reads only the `Public` branch, while
  records and build data keep the `Prototype` branch attached for provenance
- this does not yet mean all routes have distinct prototype physics payloads;
  on routes that have not been semantically repaired yet, the prototype branch
  may still coincide with the current route-native payload

Task 5 implementation note:

- the `A31` build route now specializes its public branch instead of exposing
  the raw extracted one-loop color decomposition as the default package result
- the public `A31` branch applies the lower-`A30` UV counterterm pattern to
  the leading and `Nf` components, while the prototype branch preserves the
  pre-counterterm route-native output for inspection
- the older route-native object/integrable flow has been restored for
  integration-facing work, so the public/default `BuildAntenna[...]` repair is
  now a build-side presentation boundary rather than a redefinition of the
  object route
- the remaining nonzero integrated `A31` residuals are now explicitly treated
  as deferred `Task 5b` work rather than as part of the completed build-side
  `Task 5a` repair

Task 6 implementation note:

- the IBP backend now has an explicit `NormalizeIBPIntegratedResult[...]`
  boundary that applies the family-dependent backend-to-public convention
  factor before epsilon-series truncation
- `IntegrateViaIBP[...]`, `IBPToSeriesWithDiagnostics[...]`, and the interface
  routing code now propagate `ApplyFeynCalcMS`, `KinematicScale`, and
  `NormalizeKinematicScale` all the way into that normalization boundary
- backend diagnostics now record the applied `"ConventionBridgeFactor"` beside
  the raw master-substituted and normalized pre-series expressions
- for `A31`, the convention bridge now expands deeply enough in `Epsilon` to
  survive multiplication against the route's higher poles rather than being
  truncated away prematurely
- a repeatable local verifier for this task now lives at
  `dev/verify_task6_convention_bridge.wl`; it checks the explicit A21 public
  target match and the presence of inspectable A31 convention-bridge backend
  diagnostics on the restored route-native object flow

Task 7 implementation note:

- `BuildAntenna[...]` now accepts `BuildOutputBranch -> "Public"|"Prototype"`
  as an explicit top-level selector
- the default public branch remains the stable package-facing result
- the prototype branch exposes the route-owned prototype/pre-counterterm view
  only for direct expression output, so derivation work can inspect it without
  silently changing object or integration semantics
- stored-result keys and diagnostics now record the requested
  `BuildOutputBranch`, so public and prototype replays do not collide
- `BuildAntennaObject[...]`, `ReturnAntennaObject -> True`, and
  `IntegrableForm -> True` currently reject the prototype branch on purpose,
  because those flows still define the integration-facing public contract

Task 8 implementation note:

- the package now exposes a supported package-wide defaults layer through
  `AntennaPipelineDefaults[]`, `SetAntennaPipelineDefaults[...]`, and
  `ResetAntennaPipelineDefaults[]`
- this layer works by managing the public `Options[...]` surfaces of the main
  supported entry points rather than by smuggling hidden per-call overrides
- the resulting precedence is explicit and deterministic:
  built-in defaults < package-wide user defaults < per-call options
- `AntennaPipelineDefaults[]` now also reports the built-in supported defaults
  and the currently effective supported defaults for each managed public head,
  so users can inspect which package-wide overrides are actively in force
- `AntennaPipelineConventionReport[]` and
  `AntennaRouteEnvironmentReport[...]` now both expose the active global
  defaults state, so runtime inspection and actual call behavior stay aligned

These lazily memoize reusable tree-level ingredients. The point is not only
speed. It also makes the source of shared Born objects explicit, so different
routes do not quietly drift toward different normalizations or “almost the same”
tree inputs.

### How build routing works

The public build functions live in `src/interface/build_router.wl`, but they do
not directly perform the physics work. Their main job is:

1. build the route key
2. collect options into a normalized association
3. ask for route data
4. format that route data into a plain result, an `AntennaObject`, diagnostics,
   or an `AntennaRunRecord`

The actual route orchestration happens in `src/routes/build_workflows.wl`.

At that layer the package asks `AntennaProfile[key]` what kind of route it is
dealing with. The crucial field is usually `Production`.

That `Production` field selects the workflow branch:

- `SelfInterference` means “build the amplitude, form the self-interference,
  then extract the antenna.”
- `ColorOrderedAntenna` means “build the full object, but also run the
  color-ordered reconstruction layer and expose its diagnostics.”
- `SectorSelfInterference` means “split the amplitude into named sectors and
  interfere only the route-relevant pieces.”
- `SectorSymmetrizedInterference` means “build the sector decomposition and
  then combine it through the symmetrized interference story required by that
  family.”

The extraction step is profile-driven too. The workflow does not hard-code one
universal “turn interference into antenna” rule. Instead it passes the raw
production object plus the profile to the extraction layer, whose behavior is
chosen by profile metadata such as `Extraction`, `ColourNorm`, components, and
contributions.

This is one of the main reasons the package is maintainable: the route layer
knows the family story, while the engine layer only has to know how to perform
one physical operation at a time.

### How integration routing works

The integration side follows the same architecture, but with a different
registry.

`IntegrateAntenna[...]` and `BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...]` live in
`src/interface/integration_router.wl`. They consume an `AntennaObject`, recover
its key and selection metadata, and then ask `AntennaIntegrationProfile[key]`
how that object should be integrated.

That profile decides things such as:

- whether the route defaults to `PaVe` or `IBP`
- which basis family is the natural one for the route
- which expansion order is the default target
- whether a branch needs route-specific handling

The orchestration itself lives in `src/routes/integration_workflows.wl`. That
file coordinates:

- backend selection
- special-route handling such as the current massive `A30` integrated bridge
- contribution-by-contribution stitching for routes like `A22`
- backend diagnostics
- T-term construction
- final integrated-antenna extraction

The important design point is that build metadata and integration metadata are
deliberately separate. An object may be most natural to build in one symbolic
language and most natural to integrate in another. `A21` is the clearest
example: its build-side and integration-side stories are related, but not
identical, and the architecture keeps that distinction explicit.

### Why records and diagnostics matter in this design

Because the package is profile-driven, the internal data returned by each route
is association-shaped before it is turned into a public result. That is not an
accident and it is not just for debugging.

Those associations let the package carry:

- the resolved profile
- the route story
- intermediate amplitudes or interferences
- extracted components
- backend diagnostics
- component and contribution metadata
- stored-result reconstruction data

That is what makes `ReturnRecord`, `IntermediateSteps`, and diagnostics useful
without forcing the normal user-facing API to expose raw internal machinery by
default.

For branch work, this is especially valuable. When a new route is not yet
release-complete, the code can still return an honest structured record that
explains:

- what was built successfully
- what is still provisional
- where the route stopped
- whether the result is experimental, partial, or fully supported

That is exactly how the current massive `A30` and `D30` branches are kept
callable without pretending they are finished massless release routes.

### How to think about adding a new branch

The intended extension path is usually:

1. decide the new route key
2. add or extend its `AntennaProfile[key]`
3. add or extend its `AntennaIntegrationProfile[key]` if integration is needed
4. teach the build workflow how to interpret the chosen `Production` and
   `Extraction` settings
5. add any route-specific helper module if the branch is exceptional enough to
   deserve its own file
6. expose stable diagnostics and route stories
7. only then widen the public “supported” claim in the README and verification
   scripts

In practice, the easiest way to go wrong is to skip step 2 and encode branch
behavior directly in the interface layer. That usually feels faster at first,
but it weakens the architecture quickly because future readers can no longer
see the route definition in one place.

### Why this architecture is a good fit for this repository

This repository sits in an awkward but productive middle ground:

- it is not just a one-off notebook;
- it is not a generic symbolic algebra framework;
- and it is not a package where every family is physically interchangeable.

The profile-centric design is what lets it behave like a package without
flattening away the physical differences between antenna families.

It gives the codebase:

- one stable public API
- one auditable metadata layer where family-specific choices are declared
- reusable engine functions for the small symbolic operations
- route files that read like workflow stories rather than backend tangles
- an honest place to keep experimental branches inside the runtime without
  overstating their status

If you are modifying the code into new branches, that is the main principle to
preserve. Try to add new physics by teaching the registry and route layer about
the branch, not by letting branch-specific assumptions leak outward into every
public function.
