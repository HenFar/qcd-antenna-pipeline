(* Massive A30 integrated bridge *)

(* Communicates with:
   - src/routes/integration_workflows.wl, which delegates here for the current
     non-forced massive A30 integrated route.
   - src/routes/massive_a30_unintegrated.wl and
     src/routes/massive_a30_reconstruction.wl, which define the matching
     package-side unintegrated conventions.
   - BuildAndIntegrateAntenna[...], which this file may invoke internally when
     it needs runtime master-coefficient data.

   Why this file exists:
   The massive integrated A30 path is presently a convention bridge and
   provenance layer around encoded literature information plus runtime package
   data, so it does not fit cleanly inside the generic IBP/PaVe backends. *)
