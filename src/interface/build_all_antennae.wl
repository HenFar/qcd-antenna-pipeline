(*************************************************)

(*

    This file holds quality-of-life functions to enable the user to, in one run, build all antennae of a certain model up to a certain maximum order of perturbation.

    It only communicates with BuildAntenna[] to build those same antennae. 

    So far only SMQCD (for antennae types A, B and C) is completely implemented up to NNLO. Other orders of perturbation may also be called and only antennae up to that order will be 
    built. The current skeleton also accounts for the future implementation of the SUSY (D and E antennae) and HiggsEFT (F, G and H antennae) models.

    The skeleton also accounts for the future implementation of massive antennae, though up to the current build only A30 has it implemented. That is accessed using the quarkMass option.

    The current error calls are supposed to be patched out as the package grows in complexity.
